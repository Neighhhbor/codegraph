================================ Human Message =================================

You are tasked with completing the function `crossval` in a code repository. 

    Here are the key details of this function:
    - **Namespace**: `whereami.whereami.predict.crossval`
    - **Function signature**:
    ```python
    def crossval(clf=None, X=None, y=None, folds=10, n=5, path=None):

    """
    Perform cross-validation on a given classifier using the specified data. First, if the input data X or labels y are not provided, the function will retrieve them from a given path. Then, if the number of samples in X is less than the number of folds, it will raise a ValueError 'There are not enough samples ({length of X}). Need at least {folds number}.'.
    Next, if no classifier model is provided, it will obtain one from the given path.
    It then prints "KFold folds={folds number}, running {n} times". The function then performs cross-validation by iterating n times. In each iteration, it  evaluate the performance of the classifier on each fold, and calculates the average accuracy. After each iteration, it prints "{iteration number (starting from 1)}/{n}: {average accuracy of the iteration}". Finally, after all iterations are complete, it prints "-------- total --------" and then prints the total average accuracy obtained from all iterations and returns this value.
    Input-Output Arguments
    :param clf: Classifier. The classifier to be used for cross-validation. If not provided, it retrieves the classifier from the specified path.
    :param X: Array-like. The input data features. If not provided, it retrieves the training data features from the specified path.
    :param y: Array-like. The target variable. If not provided, it retrieves the training data target variable from the specified path.
    :param folds: Integer. The number of folds to be used in cross-validation. Defaults to 10.
    :param n: Integer. The number of times to run cross-validation. Defaults to 5.
    :param path: String. The path to the training data. If not provided, the data is assumed to be already provided in X and y.
    :return: Float. The average score obtained from cross-validation.
    """
    ```

    You can retrieve some context about the function using the available tools to gather additional information.

    ### Step-by-step process:
    1. **Analyze the Current Information**:
        - If you are fully confident that the information currently available (function signature and namespace) is **enough** to complete the function, **directly complete the function**.
        crossval:
    
    2. FORMAT: **Only return the complete function's code**

    2. **Gather Additional Information (if needed)**:

    3. **Call Limit for Tools**:
        - You can only call each tool **up to 10 times** before you must decide whether you have enough information to complete the function.
